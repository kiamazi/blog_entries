A quick entry to share the information:

Tommy Stanton from the [Los Angeles Perl Mongers][1]
let me know that he gave 
a [presentation on Galuga][2] in January ([slides are
available here][3]).  He also tinkered with the mozzarella-toned beast, 
and his patches should soon percolate to the pallid cetacean's [GitHub lair][4].

Granted, those are not news that are going to shake the Perl world to its fundation. But, hey,
someone somewhere is using my blog engine. Woohoo! \o/
