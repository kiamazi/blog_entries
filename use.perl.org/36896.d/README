  <p>Just to say that my main blog is going to be <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog" rel="nofollow">here</a> (although I'm probably going to echo my posts at use.perl.org for a while still). </p><p>I love the soapbox that use.perl.org provides but the site's blogging interface is, shall we say, a tad archaic and on the painful side. I can live with the html format of entries, but many times I've longed for something a little bit more code snippet-friendly. So, when <a href="http://perlsphere.net/" rel="nofollow">Perlsphere</a> appeared at the horizon, the temptation to repatriate my blog on my own server became just too great to ignore...</p><p>Of course, considering that it's a blog about Perl blabbering, using some PHP blog engine would have not felt quite right. So I decided to experiment with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jrockway/Angerwhale" rel="nofollow">Angerwhale</a>. It's a pretty nifty engine, but it has a few rough edges. In fact, I already began to hack and patch at it... expect some entries about it sometimes soon.<nobr> <wbr></wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
