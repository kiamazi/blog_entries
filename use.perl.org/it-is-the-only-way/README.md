It's been a little bit over a year that CPAN thinks
XPathScript is stuck at version 0.16. Which, considering that it has
climbed up to version 1.45 since, it getting slightly irritating.
I tried pretty much everything I could think of to fix
the problem on my end, not to avail. So time to get the big guns: I've
reset the version to <i>undef</i> and forced a re-indexing. CPAN,
dodge that.

In related XPathScript news, a new -- and much purtier --
xpathscript demo for axkit2 has been
sent Matt's way. 

In unrelated news: on my system CPANPLUS bloats to <b>over 500 megs</b>?! Ay
caramba!
