This blog entry is light on technical content and heavy on "about me" stuff. 
So unless you're interested in the hot spots where to dispatch ninja
assassins to take me down this years (or perhaps just where we might cross
paths and shake hands), feel free to close this tab.

So, as [you](http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/asheville-part-I) 
[might](http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/asheville-part-II) 
[remember](http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/asheville-part-III), 
last year was my first ever YAPC, and it was **awesome**. So it's only
natural that the [YAPC::NA](http://yapcna.org/) of this year got automatically earmarked as 
"weally wanna go" destination.

## A Tale of Two YAPCs

If there was only one YAPC, this blog entry would ends here. But there are
more.  There is [YAPC::Asia](http://yapcasia.org), which is awesome but
slightly out of my sphere (my Japanese begins and ends with being able to
scribble the kanjis for 'tiger', 'dragon' and the numbers from 1 to 10). And
there is [YAPC::Europe](http://www.yapceurope.org/), which this year is going
to take place in Frankfurt.

Now, Frankfurt is a *veeeeery* interesting location for me.  For one, there's
a nicely convenient direct flight from Ottawa to there. And, more importantly,
it's a stone throw away from in-laws and friends. So you'll understand when I
say it beckons rather strongly as the perfect
opportunity to mix business, pleasure and, well, more pleasure.

Of course, greedy bastard than I am, I would love to attend both YAPC::NA and
YAPC::EU. But so far temporal limitations force me to chose, and in
consequences my current plans are geared toward YAPC::EU.  

This is not to say I have given up on YAPC::NA, though -- in the spirit of 
[la Chasse-Galerie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasse-galerie), there are a few devils I might try to
strike a deal with yet. In parallel to that, I'm also trying to convince some
coworkers to make their first YAPC pilgrimage so that, if everything else
fail, I'll still be there by proxy.

Beyond mere attendance, there is also always the potential of giving a talk. So far,
I'm thinking of going the easy route and stay mum. But, then again, that was
my plan for last year and... let's just say things turned out differently.
Who knows, under the right circumstances enthusiasm might 
trump survival instinct for a second year in a
row. :-)

## Meanwhile in Ottawa

Beside the two YAPCs, there are also good chances I'll be found at 
[PgCon](http://www.pgcon.org/2012/).  While PostgreSQL is a little bit more at
the periphery of what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis, the conference couldn't
be more conveniently set up. It's located smack in the middle of Ottawa, 
and happens mostly over a week-end. Considering that databases are the
bread and butter of my [$workplace](http://pythian.com), it would be almost
foolish not to take advantage of such an opportunity.

## What About You?

So, what about **your** plans? Are you planning to attend any of those events?
Want to try to sync up and meet over beer to discuss something or other? Would
really like me to give a talk about a specific topic? The comment section is
wide open, feel free to lay it all down there. :-)
