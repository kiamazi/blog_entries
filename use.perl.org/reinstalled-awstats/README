<p>Re-installed <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">awstats</a> on Babyl (a leftover task from the Great Reinstallation of Summer 2006).</p><p> Looking at its site I realized I'm still listed as one of the developers  (I contributed a small snippet of code in the days of the Code Red worm).  I should  kick myself and see if I can't dive back into it one of these days.</p><p>On an unrelated note, someone poked me via email, asking if <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/Games-PerlWar-0.01/" rel="nofollow">Perlwar</a> is dead. Nope, it's just sleeping very, very deeply. That's another thing I have to dive back into. (<b>*sigh*</b> so many things to dive into, so few speedos...)</p>
