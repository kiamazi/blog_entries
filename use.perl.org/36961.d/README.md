# Object::InsideOut Cheatsheet

<p>Everybody is raving about <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/Moose/" rel="nofollow">Moose</a> these days, but I must say that
I still prefer
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jdhedden/Object-InsideOut" rel="nofollow">Object::InsideOut</a>.  One of the things I love about
OIO is its extensive documentation
(70 glorious pages worth of pod!).  One of things that I find daunting about it is,
well,
finding back the attribute I'm looking for as I thumb through
those seventy-something blasted pages. </p><p>So I made myself a
<a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/perl/oio/oio-cheatsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">cheatsheet</a>. It's not
complete yet, but it's already containing what most mortals
would use on a daily basis.</p><p>(btw, I've used <a href="http://www.scribus.net/" rel="nofollow">Scribus</a>
to generate the 3-fold.  Although I really,
really want to like that software, I must say that it makes me
miss Quark XPress real bad.  If anyone has any suggestion for an
alternative Desktop Publishing tool, please feel free to let me know.)</p>
