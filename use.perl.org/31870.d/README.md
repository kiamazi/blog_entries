  <p>
    A few weeks ago, while I was doing one of those activities
    that allow the mind to disconnect and roam of its own (could
    have been while I was showering, or riding the bus, or attending
    a team meeting, I don't recall), an idea hit me. The
    game Monopoly has variations themed on everything under
    the sun, from countries (Canada-o-poly, eh!), to TV programs
    (the Simpsons), to pets (Cat-o-poly), to God-knows-what.
    So why not do a Perl-themed variation of it?
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      The currency of the game wouldn't be dollars, but lines
      of code (LoC).
    </li><li>
      The properties would be modules, to which you assign code
      monkeys and gurus. The different module groups could be:
      
      <blockquote><div><p><tt>Embperl HTML::Mason<br></br>
      <br></br>Acme::Bleach Acme::EyeDrops Acme::Buffy<br></br><br></br>Email::Filter Mail::SendEasy::SMTP Mail::Box<br></br><br></br>Net::Telnet Net::FTP Net::SSH<br></br><br></br>DBD::SQLite DBD::MySQL DBD::Pg<br></br><br></br>PerlQt Wx Gtk<br></br><br></br>XML::LibXML XML::XPath XML::Twig<br></br><br></br>Module::Build ExtUtils::MakeMaker<br></br></tt></p></div> </blockquote></li><li>
      The utilities would be 'perldoc' and 'perlbug'.
    </li><li>
      You wouldn't go to Prison, but would 'use Safe;'
    </li><li>
      Instead of Chance, we'd have rand().
    </li><li>
      Community chest? Surely you mean comp.lang.perl.misc.
    </li><li>
      Free Parking would be replaced by YAPC.
    </li><li>
      Railway stations would be replaced by pragmas: strict, warnings,
      bytes and utf8
    </li><li>
      Etc, etc, etc.
    </li></ul><p>
    The whole idea tickles enough my fancy that I might whip
    up an SVG rendering of the board one of those days.
