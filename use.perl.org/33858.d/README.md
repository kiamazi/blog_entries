# Trying to define badness: Shakesphackers

<p> <b>Shakesphacker</b>: (<i>n.</i>) a programer who, at the instar of Shakespeare's infamous chimps,
   randomly bang on the keyboard until the laws of probability make him
   generate a working line of code.</p><p>

   I came up with that term Friday to try to put a label on a coding philosophy I
   observed.
   I'm not entierely satisfied by it though -- it sounds way too
   sophisticated for the kind of feeling it try to convey.  "Foo flinger"
   could be more adequate.
</p><p>In all cases, shakesphackers can be easily identified by their exuberant love of <i>eval</i>s -- they firmly believe that, just like violence, if it doesn't solve your problems, it's because your not using enough of it. </p>
