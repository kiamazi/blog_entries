<p>
For the last couple of months, as a concession between
visibility and control, I'd been double-posting my blog
entries both here and on my
personal blog.
But now that my blog is registered on both the
<a href="http://perlsphere.net/" rel="nofollow">Perlsphere</a> and
<a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/" rel="nofollow">IronMan</a> aggregators,
the need for the second posts here has dwindled.  So... I'm going
on a limb and tentatively turn off the echoing.
See y'all on <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog" rel="nofollow">Hacking Thy Fearful
Symmetry</a>!</p>
