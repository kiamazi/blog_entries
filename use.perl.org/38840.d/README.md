# Ruhr.pm: Die Meister des Psycho-Lamas

<p> <i>reposted from <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog" rel="nofollow">Hacking Thy Fearful Symmetry</a> </i> </p><p>Last month, thanks to a concerted effort of German Perl Mongers[1]
I was able to meet with the wonderful folks of
<a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/" rel="nofollow">Ruhr.pm</a>. </p><p>It turns out that not only the  Ruhr-area mongers are
a superlatively friendly bunch, but they
have pretty <a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/material.psp" rel="nofollow">cool presentations</a> too. </p><p>The feature presentation of the night was
<a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/files/fuse/docshot/" rel="nofollow">Fuse mit Perl</a>,
by Simon Wilper. After he was done, I also got treated with a
quick replay of two previous presentations dealing with image
manipulation.  <a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/files/opencv/docshot" rel="nofollow">One</a>
was about openCV, a facial recognition software,
and its Perl interface, and the other one was about the <a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/files/imagemagick/docshot" rel="nofollow">uses of
Image::Magick</a>,
including the detailed instructions on how to create a psycho-llama.
That last bit, I daresay, was worth the trip to Germany
all by itself.  The script to create the thing is in the <a href="http://ruhr.pm.org/files/imagemagick/imagemagick-beispiele.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">presentation companion tarball</a>, check it out (well, unless you suffer from epilepsy, in which case you want to stay as far away as possible).</p><p>So, bottom-line: Ruhr.pm rocks big time.  If you're ever passing in the vicinity, I highly recommend paying them a visit.<nobr> <wbr></wbr></nobr>:-)</p><p>[1] Renée Bäcker saw my use.perl.org blog entry and forwarded the
information to Ruhr.pm, Veit Wahlich -- fearless leader of the Ruhrgebiet mongers --
contacted me and arranged the details, and René Knopp was dispatched
to pick me up from the train station.  Many thanks to the whole
bunch!</p>
