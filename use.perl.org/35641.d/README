At $work, an application that I wrote (<i>remora</i>, a companion
application to <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/" rel="nofollow">Wireshark</a>)
is extensively using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~atrak/NetPacket-0.04/" rel="nofollow">NetPacket</a>.
NetPacket is very handy but, alas,  has
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=7010" rel="nofollow">some</a>
<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=18941" rel="nofollow">bugs</a>,
and seem to be orphaned  (the latest update
is from 2003).  I've tried to poke the maintainers, but
Stephanie Wehner's email is no longer working, and Tim Potter didn't
reply yet (although, to be fair, I only began to poke last week).

Bottom line, I'm playing with the idea of taking over the module so that
I can churn a new version with the bug fixes.  So if
anyone out there is in contact with Stephanie or Tim, can you let
them know a madman is nefariously organizing a coup?  Thanks.<nobr> <wbr></wbr></nobr>:-)
