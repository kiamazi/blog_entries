This Thursday, I'll be presenting at the 
[Ottawa Valley SAGE][1] meeting. The topic 
of the talk will be *Perl for Sysadmins*, and
I'll try to sell to the audience how Perl can 
make their lives much, much easier. 

## On the menu 

* Perl’s command-line arguments

* Well-known idioms for common situations

* Perl as ‘sed’

* Perl as ‘awk’

* Perl as ‘find’

* From one-liner to small script and back

* Leveraging TAP as a system monitoring tool

* Must-have modules

* And much more.

## Who should be attending?

The audience is expected to have some familiarity with Unix-like
environments, as well as a basic understanding of Perl’s syntax.

At the end of this presentation, you’ll be able to

* laugh your way through the extraction the list of visitor IP
addresses off an Apache logfile

* effortlessly find rogue files in a huge, maze-like directory
structure.

* speedily encrypt/decrypt sensitive information off text files
using the NCSA-grade rot-13 algorithm.

* and generally learn a few other dirty tricks that will come in
useful on a daily basis.

## Where and when

The SAGEs will meet at the [Pythian][2] headquarters (St-Laurent shopping
center, right above the Rainbow movie theater) Thursday April 21st 2011. The show will start at
19:00, and should go on till 21:30. 

Hope to see you there!
