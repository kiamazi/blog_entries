<p>
Lately, I've been having fun with
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748" rel="nofollow">GreaseMonkey</a>.
Net result: I've
re-implemented my Perl-themed friends/foes icons
(originally
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Yanick/journal/30746" rel="nofollow">done</a>
using <a href="http://userstyles.org/stylish/" rel="nofollow">Stylish</a>)
and hacked RT to provide sorting of bugs by
severity (I got the idea for that one from
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~schwern/journal/34967" rel="nofollow">Schwern</a>'s journal). Both
monkey scripts are available on
<a href="http://userscripts.org/users/38422/scripts" rel="nofollow">userscript.org</a>.
</p><p>Also, a new version of <a href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Pod-Manual" rel="nofollow">Pod::Manual</a> is out.
The code to generate my unexpectedly wildly popular ad-hoc
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Yanick/journal/33028" rel="nofollow">Catalyst manual</a> was already included in
the previous distributions, and in this one I added a similar
manual for <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jsiracusa/Rose-DB-Object/" rel="nofollow">Rose::DB::Object</a>.
The order in which the modules are given is a little rough and
need improvement, but it's a start.  For those who care more
about the end than the means, the pdf of both manuals
are available <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/perl/pod-manual" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p><p>.
