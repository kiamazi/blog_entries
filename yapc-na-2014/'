# Yanick At Perl Conference: Notes of Attendance (YAPC::NA)

It's hard to believe that Orlando was only my third YAPC. And yet, I only
attended my first YAPC ever in [Asheville in 2011][asheville]. The next year I
went long and had a taste of the ::EU namespace with [Frankfurt][frankfurt].
For 2013 I
had to take a sabbatical for cause of a sprint/summer-long alluring game of
strip-thyroid. And that brings us to 2014, and Orlando. This year I don't
have any tall tale to tell, but nonetheless, here are a few of my
notes and impressions for the event, hoping that they will somehow whet your
appetite, and tempt you to come and join in the fun next year.

## Organization

The show rolled like a well-oiled machine.  The
venue was a pleasant one, the coffee kept flowing, and good munchies were
available during the breaks (honorable mention must go for a vegetarian
option being present for the two buffets we had). The real-time streaming was
nothing short of spectacular, and the list of talks and keynotes was superb.

Now, some grumbles have been heard about the low level of communication going on
for this YAPC. I must say, information was not disseminated as well as it
could have been. Both before the conference, and during the events  (the BOFs
weren't as strongly advertised as they should have been, I'm still uncertain
how the t-shirt printing was supposed to work).  But when you know how
short-handed the organizers were, and how Life really had a good go at driving
them insane, it makes you appreciate what they still managed to pull off.
With a little luck, next year will see more volunteers, which should help with 
the communication, and the overall general workload of all concerned.


## Game Night

This year was the first time that I experienced YAPC::NA's game night.
In a nutshell, the more official dinner party of the days of yore have been
replaced by a logistically simpler buffet (this year Mexican-themed, and quite yummy), 
and a focus on games. The official game was Magic: The Gathering, but a lot of
people brought other games, going from classics such a Scrabble, to party
favorites like Cards Against Humanity, to more involved wargames like [OGRE][].
The shift from the previous officialish dinners is to promote more
intermingling, and I must say that I like it. You grab some food, you pick a
table, and you play. As an ice breaker, it's genius. And it's fun as heck.

As it happens, I landed at Ricardo Signes' table, and has he reported in his
own [YAPC blog entry][rjbs], he had brought a few OGRE mini-kits. While the rules were
pretty simple for a wargame, it was still quite the challenge to grasp all the
details after a quick introduction and a demo game. But, in all honesty? I don't
think anybody cared. Metal behemoths rolled on the battlefield. Desperate
squadrons of men and balefully underpowered vehicules tried to make a stand.
Hilarity, and much pyrotechnic demolition, destruction and discombobulation
ensued, and we all had a blast.

## Keynotes

Oh my did we have many keynotes this year. Which, mind you, I don't begrudge,
because they were so darn good. Mark Keating and Dan Wright were quite
informative. Larry was endearing as always (I swear, this man could give a
3-hour seminar on TCL and I would still be charmed by it), Matt Trout was his
usual entertaining self. Charlie Stross was, hell, he was FRIGGIN' *CHARLIE
STROSS*,  how more cool could it get? 

And the dual keynotes of Sawyer and
Genehack on the last day were like the two sides of the same coin -- the bold,
unbridled enthusiasm of one being met with the wise, weathered experience of
the other. They uplifted, they stirred the soul. Ultimately, they begged the
question: why are we doing what we do, and how must we grow to stay who we
are. Those men are good. It was glorious.

## Knitting

You haven't slept all that much the night before. It's 1:30pm, right after 
a hefty lunch. The talk is interesting, and the person giving it *is*
a good talker. But your eyelids feel so, so heavy. More coffee is in
order as soon as you reach the break, but until then you'll have to soldier
o-- oh my, you hope that nobody saw you sharply nod down and wake yourself up. 

Sounds familiar? If so, do you want to know something that helps surprisingly
well against those attacks of languor?  Knitting! It's just involving enough
to keep the body awake, but sufficiently automatic to let the brain
concentrate on what's happening at the front of the room. I've been lugging my
knitting around for a few conferences now, and I must say it works pretty
well. I recommend. And might be tempted to give a quick tutorial one of these
days. Which brings me to...

## Off-Perl Track

This year, the organizers tried a whole track of talks dealing with
extracurricular stuff. It went to other languages like Rust to more broadly general life-related things like
coffee roasting. Frankly? I *love* the idea. Not only can it help draw outsiders who
would not be that tempted by an all-Perl conference, but it broaden the scope
of the knowledge we get to share and be exposed to during the conference to
all the shady nuggets that are peripheral to our core activities. I really
hope to see more of that during the upcoming years.

## Dancer


Within the premises of the conference, was the presence of three members of
the Dancer crew: Sawyer, Mickey and myself. So it goes without saying that we /had/ to have a Dancer BOF.
The BOFs were a little bit stealthy this year, so the crowd that showed up
wasn't huge, but that's okay -- quality over quantity and all that. In all
cases, we talked about the status of things, of when to use Dancer versus the
other frameworks, of specific use cases, of plugins, of templates, of horror
stories and of things to consider for the future. All in all, it was a
pretty nicely filled hour.

And while we're talking about Dancer. If there is one thing that made me squee
with delight at the conference, if had to be how much Dancer is used by the 
community. It's one thing to know that the project you're part of is somehow
popular, but it's something else to see listed on the stack of serious systems
and part of so many talks.

## Meatspace Meetings: Massively Meaningful

So, the event was smoothly operated. The talks were informative. The overall
atmosphere wholesomely pleasant. But I didn't mention yet why I really enjoy
going to YAPC. Oh, it's a little bit for all those reasons, sure, but mostly?
It's for
something much greater: it's to rekindle with the Tribe. It's funny. Even
though emails, Twitter, bug reports, blog entries, IRC and dozen of other
interfaces ensure that we are interconnected in tenuous and not-so-tenous ways
