The goal of most of my projects are to improve on the status quo, in some way
or other.

Sporadically, I'll also take on a project just to try my hand at a new
technology, as a kind of lab experiment.

And then, there are the more rare instances when the stars align and the
angles get weird. That's when I'll do something just for the sheer evulz
of it.

Today is one of those days. 

You all know the magic eightball. You think of a question, shake shake shake
the eightball and an answer would appear. Magic eightballs are awesome, but
*Without a doubt* is such an answer of a begone era. Wouldn't it make sense to
update the answers of the magical orb to this Age of the Meme?

No, no it wouldn't. But I did it anyway.

The application is not much. Powered by [Dancer](cpan), using [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/)
for a quick shooka-shooka effect, and the site [Know Your
Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) as a source of the memes and images.

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/yanick/memeball), as usual,
and I have an instance of the thing at
[memeball.babyl.ca](http://memeball.babyl.ca). Fair warning, though: my server
is old and decrepit, and my DSL connection is even worse, so there is no
guarantee that the instance will stay up and running for long.

Oh, and as you might suspect, the MemeBall contains coarse language and
immature subject content, viewer discretion is recommended.

Enjoy. :-)
