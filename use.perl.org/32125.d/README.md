<p>One of my resolutions for the new year is to try and
see if I can stir Ottawa.pm back to life (it kinda went
under two year-ish ago). I've already sent a humble request
to the Power that Is at pm.org to get the keys to
the ottawa.pm.org website and mailing list. But still remains
the most daunting task: gather minions. I already spotted 11
Perl programmers on meetup.com that would probably be interested.
And I should also be visiting the local LUG, always a fertile ground
for young llamas....

Anyway. No need to say, if you are in the vicinity and want to join
the fray, please feel free to frantically wave in my direction.
If not, well, wish me luck. :-)</p>
