<p>An introduction to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/XML-XPathScript/" rel="nofollow">XPathScript</a> that I gave
at this month's Ottawa Mongers Meeting can
be found <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/perl/xpathscript/slides/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  </p><p>It probably reads a wee bit cryptic
without my running commentaries, but some might still enjoy it.<nobr> <wbr></wbr></nobr>:-)
