Remember me mentioning [David Wheeler](http://www.justatheory.com)'s CPAN-like project for PostgreSQL? Well, by now it has an official name -- [PGXN](http://pgxn.org/) -- and [the ball has now been set into motion](http://www.justatheory.com/computers/databases/postgresql/pgxn-development-project.html).  This is going to be good.

[bingos](http://blogs.perl.org/users/bingos) decided to take the Dist::Zilla leap this week. [A few plugins have already been churned out](http://blogs.perl.org/users/bingos/2010/06/late-to-the-party-but-i-brought-bottles.html) as the result.

Danger Will Robinson! If you are using [File::chdir](http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-chdir), [David Golden](http://www.dagolden.com) warns that Perl 5.13.1 broke it by fixing a tied variable-related bug.  Things are expected to be back to normal with Perl 5.13.2.

In a glorious display of shininess, [garu](http://onionstand.blogspot.com) [shares with us Tweetylicious](http://onionstand.blogspot.com/2010/06/tweetylicious-twitter-like.html), a microblogging Twitter-lookalike written using [Mojolicious::Lite](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mojolicious-Lite). He even organized the commits for the project in a tutorialish way, making it the perfect introduction to Mojolicious.

[Daisuke Maki](http://mt.endeworks.jp/d-6/) brings some mind-boggling news from Japan.  A rake and ne'er-do-well seems to have applied for the copyright on the word 'Perl' in Japan... and [the request has been accepted](http://mt.endeworks.jp/d-6/2010/06/perl-trademark-in-japan.html).  Japanese mongers are not amused.

[oylenshpeegul](http://oylenshpeegul.vox.com) came up with the pattern for a [knitted Perl's camel dishcloth](http://oylenshpeegul.vox.com/library/post/knitteddishcloth.html) (which he wrote using POD, natch).  Good timing too, considering that we are in the midst of [World Wide Knit in Public Day](http://www.wwkipday.com/).

Ashley Pond V delights us with a clever mix of [Perl maze generator and CSS wizardry](http://sedition.com/a/2953).

[Dave Jacoby](http://varlogrant.blogspot.com) shares [his new-found love for IO::Interactive](http://varlogrant.blogspot.com/2010/06/absolutely-awesome-perl-modules.html).

[fREW](http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com) announces the [arrival of DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler](http://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/archives/1352), which is touted as being even more awesome than [DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class). It slices, it dices, it does upgrades *and* downgrades!

[ap0calypse](http://ap0calypse.agitatio.org) begs you to do your part to stop the all-to-general terrible abuse of `print` statements [and use heredocs](http://ap0calypse.agitatio.org/articles/please-use-here-documents) whenever justified.  

[Adam Kennedy](http://use.perl.org/~Alias) reports that the top 100 CPAN
modules (in term of dependencies) [suddenly gained some weight](http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/40387). We are still unsure of the specific cause. Personally, I blame it on the codenaming of the Windows port of Perl after delicious flavors of icecream.

Inspired by `perlbrew`, that nectar from the gods, bingos [came out with smokebrew](http://blogs.perl.org/users/bingos/2010/06/smokebrew---it-is-like-perlbrew-but-different.html), which follows the same general idea, but is geared toward the creation of Perl testing environments.

    [yanick@enkidu shuck]$ perl -E'sleep 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 # see y'all in 2 weeks!'
