<p> <a href="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/blog" rel="nofollow">Bart Trojanowki</a> gave a Git presentation to the Ottawa Ruby Group earlier
this month (I attended as a deep undercover Perl mole).  The slides and the
podcast are now available at

<a href="http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial" rel="nofollow">http://excess.org/article/2008/07/ogre-git-tutorial</a>.</p><p>Very good presentation, meant as an introduction to the beast, but
containing enough little nudgets to have anyone learn something from
it.</p>
