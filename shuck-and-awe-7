    [yanick@enkidu shuck]$ perl -MXML::LibXML \
        -E'say $_->toString for \
            XML::LibXML->load_xml( location => "news.xml")\
                       ->findnodes( q{//news[@lang="perl"]} )'
    
No one is safe from the TPF Inquisition.  
[Alberto Sim√µes](http://null.perl-hackers.net/)
[cornered Michael Schwern at YAPC](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2010/06/testbuilder-2-updates.html) and exacted 
a confession about the state of Test::Builder 2.  No doubt threatened by the 
horrid torments that only torture by the comfy chair can provide, 
the Schwern [spilled the beans](http://use.perl.org/~schwern/journal/40421).

For the readers who aren't BFF with Perl's `grep` function yet, 
[smash](http://blogs.perl.org/users/smash/) provides [a little example
how this function can help making your code shorter, faster, and most
important, easier to read](http://blogs.perl.org/users/smash/2010/06/grep-is-your-friend.html).


[Moritz Lenz](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/) announces the Perl 6 challenge of
this week: [implementing $*ARGFILES](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-argfiles.html).
He also announces the winners of the previous weeks, which have been 
[selected by a Perl 6
script](http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/contribute-now-lottery.html).

The [first draft of the Modern Perl Book is available for reviews](http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/40423), 
[chromatic](http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/) sayz.  Veterans, now is the time
to do your part and review a section or two.

[KiokuDB](http://search.cpan.org/dist/KiokuDB/) is nifty. 
[DBIx::Class](http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-Class) is awesome. 
[Yuval](http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/) has worked his magic again 
to allow [the use of the former on top for the
latter](http://blog.woobling.org/2010/03/kiokudb-for-dbic-users.html). 
Would the result be niftwesome or awesifty? You be the judge.

[brian d foy](http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/) reminds us 
that [the flip-flop operator uses a global
state](http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/blog/314),
and what it means in term of potential gotchas.


[Ovid](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/)
shares [how to post to
Blogger](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/06/getting-married-and-posting-to-blogger.html).
Oh yeah, and he's now married and has a child process in the compilation
stage. w00t! 

[Kiffin Gish](http://www.kiffingish.com) found the hard way that you 
 ever truly realize how much you need something only [after its
 gone](http://www.kiffingish.com/2010/06/dont-run-this-command.html). Oops.

In the "building bridges" department, 
Tim Bunce tackles the equivalent of a Gibraltar Strait overpass and
started a project on GitHub that [takes Java classes and translates
them into their Perl 6 equivalents](http://github.com/timbunce/java2perl6). 

[Mark Fowler](http://blog.twoshortplanks.com) discusses the art of [measuring
the performance of web
applications](http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2010/06/26/measuring/)
and gives a few pointers that I, for one, will be seriously taking into
consideration (not to mention the reference that I now have to
order). 

    [yanick@enkidu shuck]$ perl -E'sleep 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 # see y'all in 2 weeks!'
