A few weeks ago, while I was doing one of those activities
that allow the mind to disconnect and roam of its own (could
have been while I was showering, or riding the bus, or attending
a team meeting, I don't recall), an idea hit me. The
game Monopoly has variations themed on everything under
the sun, from countries (Canada-o-poly, eh!), to TV programs
(the Simpsons), to pets (Cat-o-poly), to God-knows-what.
So why not do a Perl-themed variation of it?

* The currency of the game wouldn't be dollars, but lines of code (LoC).


* The properties would be modules, to which you assign code monkeys and gurus. The different module groups could be:
      
```
Embperl HTML::Mason

Acme::Bleach Acme::EyeDrops Acme::Buffy

Email::Filter Mail::SendEasy::SMTP Mail::Box

Net::Telnet Net::FTP Net::SSH

DBD::SQLite DBD::MySQL DBD::Pg

PerlQt Wx Gtk

XML::LibXML XML::XPath XML::Twig

Module::Build ExtUtils::MakeMaker

```

* The utilities would be 'perldoc' and 'perlbug'.

*  You wouldn't go to Prison, but would 'use Safe;'

*  Instead of Chance, we'd have rand().

*  Community chest? Surely you mean comp.lang.perl.misc.

*  Free Parking would be replaced by YAPC.

* Railway stations would be replaced by pragmas: strict, warnings, bytes and utf8

* Etc, etc, etc.

The whole idea tickles enough my fancy that I might whip up an SVG rendering of the board one of those days.
