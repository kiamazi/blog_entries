<p>Don't get me wrong, I love perldoc. But for documentation that span
several manpages, I often catch myself dreaming of tables of content,
indexes, real dead-tree margins on which to annotate stuff. I'm funny that
way.</p><p>So I went back to the script that I wrote to create the <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Yanick/journal/30715" rel="nofollow">XPathScript manual</a>
and tinkered a bit with it. I then used that newly-concocted black
magick (which basically convert and agglomerate pods into a docbook, which
is then LaTeXified and subsequently pdfed) to turn the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jrockway/Catalyst-Manual-5.700501/" rel="nofollow">Catalyst
manual</a> into a cute little <a href="http://babyl.dyndns.org/misc/catalyst_manual.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a>.
Me likes. I think I'll tidy up the aforementioned script and
publish it as Pod::Manual or something of the kin as soon as time (ah!)
allows.</p><p>(and yeah, I'm in the process of getting
my feet wet with Catalyst. Last week I was hopelessly Not Getting It, but
sometime during last week-end, an angel came to me and bapped me over the
head with its trumpet. Epiphany! I grok it, now! Even better:  I think I'm digging it too!)</p>
