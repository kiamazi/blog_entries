Inspired, but not completely satisfied with [Camelia](http://perl6.org/, the Perl 6 mascot), [Sebastian Riedel](http://blog.kraih.com) came up with [a new butterfly logo for the Perl 5/6 family](http://blog.kraih.com/a-logo-for-perl). Very purty, methinks, very purty indeed.

[Schwern](http://use.perl.org/~schwern/) has implemented method and function signatures for the maverick [Perl5i](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl5i/).  The keyword for methods is easy to come up with, but for subroutine, what should it be, ['func' or 'def'](http://use.perl.org/~schwern/journal/40444)?

Need your module documentation within reach of your eyeballs whenever, wherever you are?  Rejoice, there's an app for that.  [Oload Alders](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders) and a friend came up with [iCPAN for the iPhone](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2010/07/icpan-cpan-on-your-iphone.html).

CPAN Testers 2.0 is up and running.  And [David Golden](http://www.dagolden.com) reminds us that the days of its first incarnation are counted. If you are interested to send test reports for your platform, [consider join the Tester Corp](http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/889/how-to-join-the-cpan-testers-2-0-public-beta/).

[DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com) is a new player in the search engine arena. It's also written in Perl.  In his blog, [Gabriel Weingberg](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com) [discusses its architecture](http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2009/03/duck-duck-go-architecture.html).

In the department of small-yet-fun tricks, [smash](http://blogs.perl.org/users/smash) shows us how to find out [your top 5 cli commands](http://blogs.perl.org/users/smash/2010/07/one-liner-history-command-counter.html).

[Yuval Kogman](http://blog.woobling.org) is scheming wonderful things to get Perl's exceptions to [break away from strings and embrace objects instead](http://blog.woobling.org/2010/07/are-we-ready-to-ditch-string-errors.html).

A useful tip for module maintainers from David Golden: [how to download RT patches from the command line](http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/875/downloading-rt-patches-from-the-command-line).

And, finally, [brian d foy](http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy) is [looking for hard-copies of Ther Perl Journal](http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/07/im-looking-for-issues-of-the-perl-journal.html).  If you have some sitting in a box somewhere, consider giving him a poke.
