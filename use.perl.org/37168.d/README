<p>Out of the comments  generated
by a post by <a href="http://use.perl.org/~grink/journal/37141" rel="nofollow">grink</a>,
I've learned that the location of the distribution's repository
can be inserted in the
<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html#resources" rel="nofollow">META.yml</a>.
Neato!  </p><p>And when grink asked if someone could come up with a Greasemonkey
script to extract that information and show it on the distro's
page... well, that's no simian fun I could let pass untackled.
The
resulting greasemonkey script can be found
<a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/31660" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
