# push @ISA, 'Married::Man'

<p>On Saturday, June the 23rd, me and my lovely lady joined APIs before
friends, families and the Great Whitely-Bearded Hacker in the Sky
(He was even kind
enough to schedule some wicked light effects for the event).
</p><p>
Funnily enough, both the bride and the groom were wearing pearls
for the occasion (in my case, it was an heirloom tie-pin given by
the mother-in-law). As unforgivingly geeky as it is, I must
say I got a secret kick out of that. </p>
